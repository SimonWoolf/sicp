Special Forms like (define x 3) are an exception to the general evaluation rule, as it oesn't
evaluate to something that just depends on the value of x and 3 (x has no value)

applicative-order evaluation -- eagerly evaluate all parameters*before* expanding the procedure definition. (what lisp actually does)

normal-order evaluation -- expand procedure definition first. only evaluate when the actual argument values are needed. Lazy evaluation, in other words. effective outcome: expand everything until you get an operation involving only primitive types, then evaluate.

Control flow
- (cond (<p> <e> <e> ...) (<p> <e>) (else <e>) ... ) -- last expression in sequence returned
- (if <p> <e if true> <e if false>)
- and, or, not -- and & or short circut, which means they're special forms, not procedures

Linear recursive process -- length of chain of deferred operations is linear with number of steps.

iterative process -- all we need to keep track of are the current values of the parameters.
State at any point is summarised by a fixed number of state variables. I.e. don't need any
hidden info (like the interpreter stack for a recursive process..)

A recursive procedure is the syntactic fact that it calls itself. That may or may not result in
a recursive *process*. (tail-call-optimisable <=> it does not, the process is inherently iterative)

Tree recursion -- fn calls itself more than once. (Will definitly be a recursive process). E.g. fib.
 - Space-complexity: height of the tree (e.g. for fib, linear -- when computing fib(n) need to keep track of values of fib(0) through fib(n-1))
 - Time-complexity: no. of nodes in the tree (e.g. for fib, exponential)

(for fib, much better to use the iterative process! question -- is this equivalent to memoizing the recursive one? (in terms of time-complexity), I mean - obviously not equivalent in terms of needing a stack)

anonymous functions: (lambda (x y) <body>)

let expressions:
(let ((⟨var₁⟩ ⟨exp₁⟩)
      (⟨var₂⟩ ⟨exp₂⟩)) ;
      …
  ⟨body⟩)

is syntactic sugar for:
((lambda (⟨var₁⟩ … )
   ⟨body⟩)
 ⟨exp₁⟩
 …
 )

i.e. if f(g(x), h(x)), let lets you define g and h first then define f in terms of it
which is more intuitive than defining f as a lambda then applying it to expressions for
g and h.

warning: that means that you can't define let-exprs in terms of other let-exprs

(cons a b) makes a list. car gets the first, cdr the second.

Church numerals
===============
three is a threeifier, a thing that makes 'do f'
into 'do f.f.f' (. = function composition).

So addition: a + b -> \f -> ( \x -> a(f)( b(f)(x)) )
(do the f's from b to x, then the f's from a)
multiplication: a*b -> \f -> ( a(b(f)) )
(each of the f's in b substitutes all the f's in a)
(i.e. a.b where . = function composition)
exponentiation: a^b -> (b(a))
(each of the f's in b substitutes for a itself -- i.e.
a 'threeifier')
tetration: ...?

lists
=====

(list ⟨a₁⟩ ⟨a₂⟩ … ⟨aₙ⟩) =
(cons ⟨a₁⟩
      (cons ⟨a₂⟩
            (cons …
                  (cons ⟨aₙ⟩
                        nil)…)))

(cadddr l) = (car (cdr (cdr (cdr l))))
  = fourth element of l

useful procedures:

(define (length items)
  (if (null? items)
      0
      (+ 1 (length (cdr items)))))
(define (list-ref items n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (car items)
      (list-ref (cdr items)
                (- n 1))))
(define (append list1 list2)
  (if (null? list1)
      list2
      (cons (car list1)
            (append (cdr list1)
                    list2))))
(define (last-pair l)
  (if (null? (cdr l))
      l
      (last-pair (cdr l))))

(define (reverse l)
  (if (= 0 (length l))
      '()
      (append (reverse (cdr l))
              (list (car l)))))

dotted-tail notation - (define (g f . w) (...))
